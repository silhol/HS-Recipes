# Helsingin Sanomat Recipe Extractor

The finnish Helsingin Sanomat (HS) has a wide range of nice recipes. When I cook, I like to print them out, so that I do not have to touch with greasy fingers my phone. But if one prints out the HS recipe pages, then one gets not only the one rececipe you like, but many other stuff that is of less interest for the cooking. The intend of this script is to keep your phone clean from grease & sauce and to print only one page of paper instead of 10 or more

The script should work with the current recipes of HS and with most older recipe pages of HS.

So my friend (Susanna Kallio) and I created this little python script. Some recipes require you to login (so please do that before you use the script for those recipes that require a login).

## Functionalities

You will be requested to insert the URL with the recipe.
You will then be presented with a choice of the found recipes.
You click which ones you like to print.
The chosen one will be stored as .txt in the same directory as the python script 
You will be quickly questioned if you want to print them
Then they should go directly to the printer.

## Technical Details

We used Pycharm and Windows. A wide range of modules have been loaded (under pycharm you have to add them under settings!)

## Note of copyright

The recipes are of course property of HS and this script is only to reduce the paper waste compared to "normal print".
